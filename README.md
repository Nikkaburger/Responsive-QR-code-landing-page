```
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <img src="images/qrcode.png" alt="qr code">

    height: 100%;
    margin: 0;
    display: flex;

### Continued development

My focus is on mastering modern web design techniques through continuous learning, experimentation, and a willingness to adapt to the ever-changing web landscape. 
By focusing on responsive design using, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP, to be adequately equipped to create visually stunning and user-friendly websites. Embrace new technologies, stay curious, and push the boundaries of my creativity to unlock endless possibilities in the world of web development.
